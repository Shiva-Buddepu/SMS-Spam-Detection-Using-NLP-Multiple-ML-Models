# SMS Spam Detection Using NLP & Multiple ML Models
## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a robust **spam detection system** for SMS messages using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **machine learning models**. The pipeline includes text preprocessing, feature extraction, and training multiple classifiers to predict whether a message is spam or not.

## Features
- **Text Preprocessing:**
  - Convert text to lowercase
  - Tokenization (word & sentence level)
  - Removal of stopwords and punctuation
  - Stemming using Porter Stemmer
- **Feature Extraction:**
  - Bag of Words (CountVectorizer)
  - TF-IDF Vectorization
- **Machine Learning Models:**
  - Naive Bayes (Gaussian, Multinomial, Bernoulli)
  - Support Vector Machine (SVC)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Decision Tree & Random Forest
  - Logistic Regression
  - Ensemble Methods: AdaBoost, Bagging, Extra Trees, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost
- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Confusion Matrix
